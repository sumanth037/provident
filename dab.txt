this is the testing file which will state that i am still knowning something.

new chapter is now build so that i can use the knowledge to grow myself.
name = "Alice"  # String
age = 30        # Integer
height = 1.75   # Float
is_student = True # Boolean

print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}, Height: {height}, Student: {is_student}")

now i am going to tesst the web hooking of the git hub and jenkins GUI . so will see whether this will work.
